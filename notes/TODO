###Priorities

1. Gtk Application and preventing multiple instances
2. Insensitive checks in Appearance sections
3. Installation and removable themes in Appearance sections
4. Prevent crashing upon missing schema / key -- AssertionError
       - Mainly Touchpad (Under System Section - Touch - Scrolling and
       - Overlay scrollbar (Under System Section - Scrollbars)
5. [Only on 13.04] Launcher icon size can be set below 32 -- up to 8 pixels.
6. Prevent same keybindings from being set
7. Add √Ångel Araya `<al.arayaq@gmail.com>` to all files.
8. Symbolic icon colourising
9. Two more options in window manager:

     - checkbox in Window snapping: `<checkbox>` Activate hot corners by clicking on them
     - 2nd one (Resize colours) is wibbly to get correct- but we can stack it in Window Manager - Additional for now:
         * *Resize window*
         * Outline colour: `<gtk-colour-box>`
         * Fill colour: `<gtk-colour-box>`
